Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs Source Code
=======================
heya!! this is my fork of Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs and its HPL 2 engine.

I'm still setting things here up.. my long-term goals are to upgrade the game engine to use more modern libraries, have Vulkan instead of OpenGL for rendering, and doing a bunch of optimization in general.

If you use this fork of the code, be sure to change the working directory to *your* install of Amnesia, because mine is at a weird path that yours probably won't be at!
